## Use at your own risk. Stick with XML.

Converting [International Data Exchange Service](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/international-data-exchange-service) and [Common Reporting Standard](http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/common-reporting-standard/schema-and-user-guide/#d.en.345315) from XML to protocol buffers. 

##### Reason

I want to learn about International Data Exchange Service and Common Reporting Standard. Also, to see if protocol buffers could be a better tool than XML.
